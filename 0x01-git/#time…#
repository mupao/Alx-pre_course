To illustrate that, please merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”

HHHHHHHAAAAAAAA

CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/alx
As you can see, you have conflicts between two branches on the same file.

Your goal now is to resolve conflicts by using the version of the branch update_script, and push the result to the origin.

At the end, you should have all your work from the branch update_script (new file and two updated files) and all latest main commits (new files, delete folder, etc.), without conflicts.0;276;0c
